# PlexPersonalPlaylistAPI

Created a small api that would allow me to automate uploading my locally created music playlists on MusicBee to my plex media server that is hosted on an NVIDIA Shield device.
For more context, I run a windows task that would trigger a FreeFileSync batch that would send my music library to the storage where I store my meedia files for plex to read,
and I do the same with the auto backed up playlists generated by MusicBee.

The playlist files are in m3u format, and hence rely on relative paths for my local music. So in order to both convert my playlists, and detect the newly created/removed/updated playlists,
I created this api to do just that. 

I drew inspiration from this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/hmunh9/comment/fx7q933/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

Basically that led me to know about the existance of the python Plex API.
